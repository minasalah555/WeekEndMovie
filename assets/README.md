# Assets for Interactive Website (Khamsate Project)

This folder contains curated images and SVGs to quickly make your site feel more interactive.

## Structure
- images/
  - hero/: Hero banners (Unsplash Source)
  - people/: Team/portrait placeholders (Unsplash Source)
  - backgrounds/: Gradient and pattern SVGs
  - icons/: SVG icons (Tabler Icons)
  - mockups/: Browser and phone SVG frames
  - placeholders/: Generic SVG placeholders (16:9, 1:1)

## Usage Notes
- Prefer SVGs where possible for speed and crisp scaling.
- Optimize JPGs/PNGs in build (e.g., `sharp`, `imagemin`).
- Lazy-load below-the-fold images; provide width/height to avoid CLS.
